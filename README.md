# This is a multi-vendor pharmacy website

You can see the live site by clicking [here](https://pharmacy-app-59.netlify.app/)

## The site is deployed on netlify

In the website user must enter as a customer or as a vendor. If anyone don't have any vendor account, he/she can apply as a vendor. After applying an automated email will be sent on user's email address.

The project is built with:
    <ul>
        <li>React js</li>
        <li>Redux</li>
        <li>Firebase</li>
    </ul>

Besides, I have used a few node packages in this project.
